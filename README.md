Tmux IntelliJ Plugin
=====================

Plugin that provides Tmux integration with IntelliJ. First pass will be the ability to send data to a specific Tmux panel, which can allow for easy REPL integration with IntelliJ, although I'm sure it can be used for other things.

Usage
------
1. First select a the pane you want your highlighted text to go to through *Tools > Tmux > Select Pane*. This pane selection is persisted until you restart IntelliJ.
1. To paste text to the Tmux pane from here, you can select the *Send Selected to Tmux* action (*Tools > Tmux*, or through the right click menu), or through the shortcut key, Ctrl+B, V.
